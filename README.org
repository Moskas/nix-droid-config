#+title: Readme

My experimental [[https://github.com/nix-community/nix-on-droid][nix-on-droid]] flake.
As of now it has a minimal copy of my main [[https://github.com/Moskas/nixos-config][flake]] for shell and git configs.

* Configured Hosts
 - Boise - my main phone
 - Dewey - my e-reader

* Install
After the initial nix-on-droid bootstrap with flakes we need to add git to our current config at *~/.config/nix-on-droid/nix-on-droid.nix*
like so:
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
environment.packages = with pkgs; [
  git
];
#+END_SRC

Then we need to switch to the updated flake, clone the repo and rebuild with the cloned flake.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
nix-on-droid switch --flake .#boise
#+END_SRC
